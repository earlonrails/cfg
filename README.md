This should work without the hero dependent features out of the box. When you want to use these, you will need to open the console and type `exec hero\'name'` where name is the 'name' of the hero. These are diffrent to normal in most cases, but the common DotA2 player will know them. And example of getting Axe and Naga Siren:
   
    exec hero\axe
    exec hero\naga

How it works
---
This uses the fact that ctrl ability, levels the pressed ability up. This allows us to utalis a little loop, that counts to 4 on normal abilites and 3 on your ult. Each time you level up you exicute a small command, that defults to a small echo, however hero's like axe have it so that your health per verticle marker changes each level of culling blade, to easily determin if you can deal an insta-kill. Or hero's like sniper increase there range.
We also utalise a modifyer on the ctrl key to determin if you are casting your ability or leveling it up.

The other code is currently rather simple, so if you want to know how that works I recomend you look at it.
